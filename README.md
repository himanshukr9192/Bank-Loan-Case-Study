Identifying there are outliers in the dataset. mentioning why it is an outliers.

Identifying  if there is data imbalance in the data. Finding the ratio of data imbalance.

Explaining the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc. in business terms.

Finding the top 10 correlation for the Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable). I have to find the top correlation by segmenting the data frame w.r.t to the target variable and then finding the top correlation for each of the segmented data and finding if any insight is there. Say, there are 5+1(target) variables in a dataset: Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Target. And if you have to find top 3 correlation, it can be: Var1 & Var2, Var2 & Var3, Var1 & Var3. Target variable will not feature in this correlation as it is a categorical variable and not a continuous variable which is increasing or decreasing.

Included visualizations and summarizing the most important results in the presentation.
